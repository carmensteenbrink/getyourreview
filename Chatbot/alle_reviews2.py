The program was developed in the late twentieth century to design simpler 3D objects than the then 3D programs, which often require a course to handle the complicated software. Some of his features make it possible for designers to "play" designers, something that is impossible with CAD programs. It is possible to draw buildings using SketchUp and show these buildings in Google Earth as three-dimensional objects. The program includes a helidone (shadow simulator), but the biggest breakthrough has this program due to the Push-Pull technology, which makes it easy to induce or pull out a 3D model.', 'There are two variants of the program: SketchUp Make and SketchUp Pro.
